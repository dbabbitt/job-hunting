# job-hunting
This is my job hunting pipeline

## Installation
Right now, <code>C:\Users\dev\Documents\Repositories\job-hunting</code> is where I'm keeping this, so you need to search for every instance of <code>C:\Users\dev</code> (in the .gitignore, jupyter_notebook_config.py, *.yml; and *.ps1; files) and figure out which needs to be replaced with the path to your home folder, and which needs <code>C:\Users\dev\Documents\Repositories\job-hunting</code> replaced with the path to this job-hunting folder you pulled or downloaded. If your os.sep isn't a backslash, you need to replace the backslashes in the rest of the path strings with what works on your OS.
