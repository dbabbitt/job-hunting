We expect that B2B sales will be a major, if not primary, source of revenue for Calm in the near future. Thus, you should enjoy “wearing multiple hats” and be comfortable operating in a startup-like environment with plenty of ambiguity, rapid change and lighting-fast growth. You will need enough experience and leadership qualities to influence the B2B team - to help them understand the full potential of data science and be proactive in leading new strategic data initiatives, aiming to reduce reactive requests. You should be able to grow the B2B team’s data culture and develop processes and standardization around data as needed. Your projects in this role will be focused on helping the team prioritize their efforts, make smarter decisions and iterate more quickly. You will help the team become more self-serve and will automate and scale up data products so that we can quickly grow the B2B team without needing to linearly grow the data science team.</p>: 0\n",
